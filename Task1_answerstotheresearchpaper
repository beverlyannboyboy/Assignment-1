1. What is the medically relevant insight from the article?
Clinical significance: This research mapped out the regulatory elements that control gene expression in different cell types across 23 human tissues. 
The key finding is that we can now trace disease-associated genetic variants back to the specific cells and regulatory regions where they actually have an impact.
The data shows some interesting patterns. For rheumatoid arthritis, the relevant genetic variants affect T cells by influencing how genes like PTGER4 are regulated, 
even though these genes are expressed in many cell types. Heart attack risk variants seem to work through regulatory elements in blood vessel cells - the smooth muscle cells, 
endothelial cells, and fibroblasts that make up arteries and veins. Height-related variants target cartilage cells (chondrocytes) and affect key bone development genes including SOX9 and RUNX2.
This approach could change how we think about treating diseases. Instead of just knowing that a genetic variant increases disease risk, we now know which cell types to target and which regulatory 
pathways are involved. It also helps explain why many disease variants fall in non-coding regions of the genome - they're affecting the switches that turn genes on and off rather than the genes 
themselves.

2. Which genomics technology/ technologies were used?
•  Single-cell 3’ RNA-seq (sc-end3-dT) – for gene expression profiling at the 3′ end of transcripts in individual cells.
•  Single-cell 5’ RNA-seq (sc-end5-dT and sc-end5-rand) – for capturing 5′ transcript ends and identifying transcribed cis-regulatory elements (tCREs) at single-cell resolution.
•  Single-cell ATAC-seq (sc-ATAC-seq) – for profiling chromatin accessibility in individual cells, identifying accessible regulatory elements (aCREs).
•  Bulk RNA-seq – for transcriptome profiling in iPSC and DMFB cell lines.
•  Bulk ATAC-seq – for chromatin accessibility profiling in iPSC and DMFB cell lines.
•  Bulk CAGE (nAnT-iCAGE) – for mapping transcription start sites and active promoters in iPSC and DMFB cell lines.


3. Further related research questions
a. List and explain at least three questions/ hypotheses you can think of that extend the analysis presented in the paper.
1.	Do distal tCREs (D-tCREs) regulate context-specific alternative promoter usage, and how does this regulation differ between resting and stimulated states in immune cells?
Explanation: The paper identifies P-tCREs and D-tCREs and links D-tCREs to promoters via co-activity and chromatin interactions. A natural extension is to examine whether D-tCREs drive alternative 
promoter usage in activated versus resting PBMCs (e.g., after PMA/ionomycin stimulation). This could involve comparing promoter usage scores (proportion of UMI from each promoter) across conditions 
and correlating D-tCRE activity with differential promoter usage, potentially revealing mechanisms of inducible gene regulation.

2.	Are high-intensity distal tCREs (HIFI loci) conserved across mammals, and do human-specific tCREs correspond to human-specific traits or disease susceptibility?
Explanation: While the study focuses on human tCREs and GWAS trait associations, comparing tCREs to orthologous regions in other primates or mammals could reveal which regulatory elements are 
evolutionarily conserved versus human-specific. Hypothesis: conserved tCREs mediate fundamental cellular functions, whereas human-specific tCREs may regulate uniquely human traits or harbor SNPs 
associated with human diseases.

3.	How do histone modifications or DNA methylation patterns correlate with tCRE activity at single-cell resolution, and can these epigenetic marks predict cell type– or trait-specific tCRE function?
Explanation: The current study integrates scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq to define tCREs and their promoter interactions. A logical next step is to integrate single-cell epigenetic data (e.g., scChIP-seq 
for H3K27ac/H3K4me1, sc-methylome) to test whether active histone marks or methylation states predict tCRE activity. Hypothesis: tCREs marked by active enhancers in specific cell types are more likely 
to regulate trait-relevant genes and show enrichment for heritability in those cell types.
